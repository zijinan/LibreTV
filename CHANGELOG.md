### Changed

- Updated the privacy complaint contact email to `9991818@gmail.com`.

## 1.2.14 - 2026-05-12

### Changed

## 1.2.13 - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Fixed player resource switching after search relevance helpers moved out of the player page load path.
- Player resource switching now falls back to the default selected sources when no local source selection exists.

## 1.2.12 - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Refreshed the player surface with progress-preview UI, autoplay fallback, and source switching that resumes from the current playback time.

## 1.2.11 - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Search results now require title relevance so sources that ignore keywords cannot flood unrelated adult content into normal searches.
- The `成人视频` home tag now loads latest entries from selected adult sources instead of querying Douban as a normal tag.
- Normal Douban home categories now filter adult-looking cards and keep adult content isolated to the dedicated adult tag.

## 1.2.10 - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Yellow content filtering now skips adult sources before searching and filters adult-looking results by title, type, remarks, content, and source.
- When yellow content filtering is disabled, adult results use a dedicated `成人视频` badge instead of mixing adult categories into normal result labels.
- The settings panel no longer embeds the source health report; its diagnostics entry is now labeled `检测源`.

## 1.2.9 - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Source health checks now run up to 10 probes concurrently to reduce waiting time.

### Changed

- Source health checks now cover all built-in and custom sources instead of only the default selected sources.
